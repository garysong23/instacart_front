### Setup
`npm install`
then `npm start`

client should render at http://localhost:8080/

### Overview
Creates 3 end points.
`\`, `\register`and `\confirmation`

`\register` contains the bulk for the implementation

Screenshots are available in `\demo_imgs`.
Screenshots are sorted in order of occurance.

### Limitations
The following could not be completed in time.

1. Styling for landing page `\`
2. Form validations
3. Session persistence
4. Tests
5. Errors displays for incomplete/incorrect inputs
6. Complete copy for questionaires

### Additional Work
Would have made the following choices if given more time.
1. Centralize all css code instead of appending to the bottom of .js files
2. Polishing design and copy
